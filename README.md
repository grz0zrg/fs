# fs
GLSL powered HTML5 web audio spectral synthesizer

[Explanation](http://www.garzul.tonsite.biz/wordpress/2016/07/23/fragment-synthesâ€¦tral-synthesizer/)

This make use of the [WUI](https://github.com/grz0zrg/wui), [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) library

This was build with a not yet released live build system but the project can be built out of the box if you find a way to run a pre-processor on **js/app_fs.js** and **css/app_fs.css** files which look for the /*include filename*/ directive and include the file **filename** content.
